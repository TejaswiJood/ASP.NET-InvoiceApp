Project Overview:
The culmination of this project signifies a significant leap in the proficiency of developing robust and feature-rich database-driven ASP.NET Core MVC web applications. The objective was to build upon the foundation laid in previous assignments, with a focus on a more intricate data model that incorporated several 1-to-1 and 1-to-many relationships. Throughout the development process, various key skills were honed, ranging from the implementation of view models and attribute routing to the application of LINQ, EF Core, and the design of a hypermedia-rich user experience.

Key Achievements and Features:

View Models and Attribute Routing:

Developed view models for enhanced data presentation.
Employed attribute routing for improved control over URL patterns.
Core Business Logic in a Service:

Implemented a scoped service to encapsulate and manage core business logic effectively.
Ensured separation of concerns and maintainability.
Unit Testing:

Established a robust xUnit project with a suite of tests to validate the functionality of the application's core components.
Ensured reliability and ease of future maintenance.
LINQ and EF Core Mastery:

Demonstrated proficiency in leveraging LINQ and EF Core to interact with a rich data model.
Efficiently queried and manipulated entities for seamless application functionality.
Hypermedia Design for Enhanced User Experience:

Maximized the "hypermedia design" to intuitively reflect relationships between various entities.
Facilitated smooth navigation within the application.
Data Validation and User-Friendly UI:

Implemented comprehensive data validation constraints for entity fields.
Provided clear error messages and visual cues for effective user interaction.
Soft Delete Pattern and Undo Feature:

Incorporated the "soft delete pattern" for entities, ensuring a reversible delete action.
Implemented an undo feature with a user-friendly interface.
Paging Solution for Improved Navigation:

Engineered a paging solution for Customers, organizing them into alphabetical groups.
Enhanced user experience by simplifying navigation within the application.
Code Reusability with ASP.NET Core Mechanisms:

Leveraged ASP.NET Core mechanisms for code reuse, particularly in Razor views.
Utilized partial views to eliminate redundancy in form elements.
Page-by-Page Description:

Customers Page:

Facilitates adding new Customers, navigating to alphabetical groups, and viewing a table of Customers with various actions.
Implements soft delete with an undo feature and incorporates paging for easier navigation.
Add/Edit Customer Pages:

Provides seamless user interfaces for adding and editing Customer information.
Ensures validation requirements are met and avoids redundancy through the use of partial views.
Customer's Invoices Page:

Displays detailed information about a Customer's invoices, enabling easy navigation.
Supports the addition of new line items and invoices with a user-friendly interface.

Conclusion:
This project serves as a testament to the acquired skills in ASP.NET Core MVC development, showcasing the ability to create sophisticated web applications with a focus on best practices, code organization, and a user-centric design. The comprehensive implementation of various features and adherence to project guidelines reflect a mastery of the technology stack and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.
